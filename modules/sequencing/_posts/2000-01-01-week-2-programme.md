### Thursday and Friday

_Bioinformatics tutorial led by Nabil-Fareed Alikhan_

> Much of Bioinformatics (via computing) is about building musle memory around operating a computer, and memorizing the syntax. These exercises will give you oppotunity to practice these skills, even though some these topics will have been presented in week 1. 

* **[File compression]({{site.baseurl}}/modules/sequencing/file-compression/)**
    * [Using tar and gzip](/seq-data/using-gzip)
* **[Revisiting sequence file formats]({{site.baseurl}}/modules/sequencing/sequence-data/)**
    * [Exploring file formats](/seq-data/file-formats)
    * [FASTQ in detail](/seq-data/fastq-in-detail)
