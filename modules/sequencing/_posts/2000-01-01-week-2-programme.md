# Week 2: Creating and handling sequences

**Week beginning October 30th 2023**

Tutors: David Baker (david.baker@quadram.ac.uk) and Nabil-Fareed Alikhan (nabil-fareed.alikhan@quadram.ac.uk)

Note that these sessions are part of your mandatory training. Please email the organisers if you are going to be late or are unable to attend through illness. For ThuPlease bring your MacBooks and ensure that you can log on to Eduroam.

**Venue:** report to Quadram Institute reception at 9.00am on Monday October 30th and Tuesday October 31st

***

### Monday

- **Hands on sequencing demonstration run by David Baker**
 	-	exciting chance to see sequences are generated on the Illumina platform

***

### Tuesday 
- **Hands on sequencing demonstration run by David Baker**
 	-	exciting chance to see sequences are generated on the Oxford Nanopore platform

### Thursday

_Bioinformatics tutorials led by Nabil-Fareed Alikhan_

**Venue:** Thursday 2nd November: UG44B 9.00am to 12.00pm

> Much of Bioinformatics (via computing) is about building musle memory around operating a computer, and memorizing the syntax. These exercises will give you oppotunity to practice these skills, even though some these topics will have been presented in week 1.
