title: Install conda
---

We will run Anvio locally, so we need to install it on our Macbooks.
We will use [conda](https://conda.io/docs/) to install Anvio and its dependencies.


## Install Rosetta

To install conda, we will first need a to install Rosetta (to emulate Intel binaries) and a compiler:

```bash
softwareupdate --install-rosetta --agree-to-license
```

Now we can configure our Terminal to be executed under rosetta, which can make our life easier:

1. Locate the Terminal application in the Finder
1. Right-click and select `Get Info`
1. Tick the checkbox `Open using Rosetta`

### Check the terminal is running under Rosetta

Completely quit the terminal (Cmd+Q) and open it again.
Try with 

```bash
arch
```

the output must be `i386` (not `arm64`).

## Install the compiler

```bash
xcode-select --install
```

This will open a window to install the command line tools!
