# Week 5: Metagenomics and Python
**Week beginning December 4th 2023**

**Tutors**: **Mark Pallen** ([mark.pallen@quadram.ac.uk](mailto:mark.pallen@quadram.ac.uk)) and **Andrea Telatin** ([andrea.telatin@quadram.ac.uk](mailto:andrea.telatin))

Note that to fit in with room availability, this week's course runs as follows
- Tuesday, Wednesday, Friday all day
- Thursday afternoon

### Topics

1. Whole metagenome profiling (taxonomy, function) using Kraken, Metaphlan and Humann
2. Whole metagenome *de novo* assembly and binning
3. The Anvi'o workbench for binning and MAG (Metagenome-Assembled Genome) refinement
4. Quality checks on MAGs
5. Taxonomic classification of MAGs

### Dataset

We will use some samples from [a paper](https://www.microbiologyresearch.org/content/journal/mgen/10.1099/mgen.0.000293) from
Mark Pallen's group about comprehensive analysis of faecal metagenome samples from patients on the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). 
They found that ICU patients had significant alterations in their faecal microbiome composition, including depletion of beneficial bacteria and an increase in potentially pathogenic species.
