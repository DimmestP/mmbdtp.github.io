# Metagenomics Course Glossary

## A

- **Ancient DNA**
  Ancient DNA refers to DNA extracted from ancient specimens. It can provide insights into evolutionary biology and historical disease patterns.

## B

- **Bins/Binning**
  In metagenomics, binning is the process of grouping contigs or sequences that originate from the same species or similar groups of organisms within a complex sample.
- **Bracken**
  Bracken (Bayesian Reestimation of Abundance with KrakEN) is a statistical method that estimates the abundance of species in metagenomic data, building upon the taxonomic classification framework provided by Kraken. [Bracken on GitHub](https://github.com/jenniferlu717/Bracken).

- **Brucella**
  Brucella is a genus of bacteria that cause brucellosis, which is a highly contagious zoonosis. [CDC page on Brucellosis](https://www.cdc.gov/brucellosis/index.html).

## C

- **Class**
  In Linnean taxonomy, class is a rank above the order level and below the phylum level. An example is *Mammalia* for mammals.

- **Coverage**
  Coverage refers to the average number of times a nucleotide is sequenced. High coverage can lead to more accurate and complete genome assemblies. [Understanding Genome Coverage](https://www.illumina.com/science/technology/next-generation-sequencing/plan-experiments/coverage.html).

- **Culturomics**
  Culturomics is a field of research that uses culture-based techniques to study the microbiome, often complementing metagenomic approaches.

## F

- **Family**
  Family is a rank in Linnean taxonomy situated between order and genus. For example, the *Enterobacteriaceae* family includes many gut bacteria.

## G

- **Genus**
  Genus is a taxonomic rank used in the biological classification of living and fossil organisms, which is above species and below a family. An example is *Escherichia*.

- **GTDB**
  The Genome Taxonomy Database (GTDB) is a comprehensive resource for taxonomic classification of bacterial and archaeal genomes based on phylogenomics. [GTDB Website](https://gtdb.ecogenomic.org/).

## I

- **Indel**
  Indels are insertions or deletions of bases in the genome. They are a common type of genetic variation and can be important in disease.

- **Intensive Care Unit (ICU)**
  ICUs are specialized sections within a hospital dedicated to critically ill patients that require intensive monitoring and care. Metagenomic studies in the ICU can be critical for infection control and outbreak investigations.

## K

- **k-mer**
  A k-mer is a substring of length k contained within a biological sequence. k-mers are fundamental to many algorithms in bioinformatics, including those used for sequencing data analysis.

- **Kraken**
  Kraken is a system for assigning taxonomic labels to short DNA sequences, typically taken from metagenomic datasets. [Kraken on GitHub](https://github.com/DerrickWood/kraken2).

## L

- **Linnean Taxonomy**
  Linnean taxonomy is the traditional system for classifying and naming organisms using a hierarchical structure with fixed ranks like phylum, class, order, family, genus, and species. [Linnaean Taxonomy](https://ucmp.berkeley.edu/history/linnaeus.html).

## M

- **MAGs (Metagenome-Assembled Genomes)**
  MAGs are genomes assembled from metagenomes, which are direct genetic representations of microbial communities.

- **Metabarcoding**
  Metabarcoding is a technique for identifying organisms within a sample by using a short, standardized region of DNA, like the 16S rRNA gene in bacteria.

- **Metagenome**
  A metagenome is the collective genomic content of a microbiome, obtained directly from environmental samples.

- **Metaphlan**
  MetaPhlAn is a computational tool for profiling the composition of microbial communities from metagenomic sequencing data. [MetaPhlAn on GitHub](https://github.com/biobakery/MetaPhlAn).

- **MultiQC**
  MultiQC is a tool that aggregates results from bioinformatics analyses across many samples into a single report. [MultiQC Website](http://multiqc.info/).

- **Mummy**
  A mummy is a dead human or animal whose soft tissues have been preserved through exposure to chemicals, extreme cold, very low humidity, or lack of air. Studies of mummies can reveal insights into ancient diseases, including tuberculosis.

- **Mycobacterium tuberculosis**
  The pathogenic bacterial species responsible for tuberculosis in humans.

## O

- **Order**
  In the hierarchy of biological classification, the order is a rank above family and below class. An example is *Carnivora* for carnivorous mammals.

## P

- **Phylum**
  Phylum is a level of classification or taxonomic rank below kingdom and above class. In bacteria, for instance, Firmicutes is a commonly known phylum.

## R

- **Rank**
  In taxonomy, a rank is the relative level in a taxonomic hierarchy. Examples of ranks include domain, kingdom, phylum, class, order, family, genus, and species.

## S

- **SemiBin2**
  SemiBin2 is an application for semiautomated binning in metagenomic analyses that combines deep learning and traditional binning methods.

- **Species**
  Species is the principal natural taxonomic unit, ranking below a genus, and denoted by a Latin binomial, e.g., *Homo sapiens*.

- **16S**
  The 16S rRNA gene is a part of the ribosomal RNA and is used for taxonomic classification and identification in bacteria and archaea.

## T

- **Tuberculosis**
  Tuberculosis is a disease caused by the bacterium *Mycobacterium tuberculosis*. It primarily affects the lungs and can be fatal if not treated properly. [CDC Tuberculosis](https://www.cdc.gov/tb/).
