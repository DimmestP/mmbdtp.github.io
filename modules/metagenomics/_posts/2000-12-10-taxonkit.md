[**TaxonKit**](https://bioinf.shenwei.me/taxonkit/usage/) is a versatile command-line toolkit designed for processing and manipulating taxonomic data, particularly from the NCBI database.
Here is a short tutorial on how to convert a file containing [NCBI TaxIDs](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/taxonomy) into a list of species names using TaxonKit:

### Use existing database

Taxonkit requires a database to work, we can all use the same one:

```bash
ln -s /shared/public/db/taxonomy $HOME/.taxonkit
```

### Getting Lineage Details of a Single TaxID

First, you can get the lineage details of a specific TaxID.
For example, for the TaxID `2697049`:

```bash
echo "2697049" \
    | taxonkit lineage -t \
    | csvtk cut -Ht -f 3 \
    | csvtk unfold -Ht -f 1 -s ";" \
    | taxonkit lineage -r -n -L \
    | csvtk cut -Ht -f 1,3,2 \
    | csvtk pretty -Ht
```

This command sequence will provide detailed lineage information, including ranks like
*superkingdom*, *phylum*, *class*, *order*, etc., for the given TaxID​​.

This is one of the powerful examples from the documentation. Let's disassemble the pipe:

* `echo "2697049"`: This command simply prints the TaxID 2697049.
* `| taxonkit lineage -t`: The output from echo is piped to taxonkit, which retrieves the full taxonomic lineage for the TaxID. The `-t`` flag returns the result in a tab-delimited format.
* `| csvtk cut -Ht -f 3`: This command uses csvtk, a versatile CSV toolkit, to process the tab-delimited output. cut is used to select fields from the tabular data. `-Ht` indicates no header in the input and tab-delimited format. `-f 3` selects the third field, which is the full lineage.
* `| csvtk unfold -Ht -f 1 -s ";"`: This further processes the lineage data. unfold is used to unfold rows into multiple rows. `-Ht` again indicates no header and tab format, `-f 1` selects the first field, and `-s ";"` specifies the separator for unfolding, which is a semicolon, as the lineage is semicolon-separated.
* `| taxonkit lineage -r -n -L`: The unfolded data is piped back into taxonkit to get readable names of the taxonomic units. `-r` uses only the representative ranks, `-n` includes names, and `-L` lists them.
* `| csvtk cut -Ht -f 1,3,2`: This csvtk command again cuts the tab-delimited data, selecting fields 1, 3, and 2, in that order.
* `| csvtk pretty -Ht`: Finally, csvtk pretty is used to format the output into a more readable table format. -Ht again indicates no header and a tab-delimited input.

:bulb: as usual, try to build the pipe one command at the time and see the effect of the previous

### Converting Multiple TaxIDs to Species Names

If you have a file (e.g., `taxids.txt`) containing multiple TaxIDs,
you can format them to various taxonomic ranks.

### For 7-level ranks (superkingdom to species)

```bash
cat taxids.txt \
    | taxonkit reformat -I 1
```

This command will output the lineage in a semi-colon separated format for each TaxID​​.

### Formatting to 8-Level Ranks

To include subspecies or ranks, you can extend to 8-level ranks:

```bash
cat taxids.txt \
    | taxonkit reformat -I 1 -f "{k};{p};{c};{o};{f};{g};{s};{t}"
```

This command will provide an extended classification including subspecies or rank​​.

### Handling Unassigned Ranks

If some ranks are unassigned, you can replace them with a placeholder like "Unassigned":
swift

```bash
cat taxids.txt \
    | taxonkit reformat -I 1 -r "Unassigned" -f "{k}\t{p}\t{c}\t{o}\t{f}\t{g}\t{s}\t{t}" \
    | csvtk pretty -H -t
```

This command ensures that all taxonomic levels are represented, even if some information is missing​​.

### Adding Prefixes and Handling Missing Ranks

To add prefixes (e.g., `k__` for kingdom, `p__` for phylum) and handle missing ranks:

```bash
cat taxids.txt \
    | taxonkit reformat -I 1 -F -P -f "{k}\t{p}\t{c}\t{o}\t{f}\t{g}\t{s}\t{t}" \
    | csvtk pretty -H -t
```

This command formats the output with prefixes and accounts for any missing ranks​​.
Extracting Specific Details (Species and Strain):

If you want to extract only specific details like species and strain:

```bash
cat taxids.txt \
    | taxonkit lineage -r -L \
    | taxonkit reformat -I 1 -F -S -f "{k}\t{p}\t{c}\t{o}\t{f}\t{g}\t{s}\t{t}" \
    | cut -f 1,2,9,10 \
    | csvtk add-header -t -n "taxid,rank,species,strain" \
    | csvtk pretty -t
```

This command provides a simplified view, focusing on the species and strain for each TaxID​​.
In summary, TaxonKit offers a powerful and flexible way to work with taxonomic data from NCBI, enabling users to convert TaxIDs to detailed taxonomic lineages, handle unassigned ranks, and extract specific taxonomic details.
