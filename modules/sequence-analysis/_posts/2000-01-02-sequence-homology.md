# Sequence homology and alignment

### Day 1

##### Overview of the day/week 

##### Talk (Pallen):  *Sequence Homology: Theory and Practice*

  -  _Sequence homology_ ([Powerpoint slides](https://github.com/mmbdtp/mmbdtp.github.io/raw/gh-pages/modules/sequence-analysis/_posts/Sequence%20homology_2023.pptx))

##### Instructions for problem-based learning on homology searches (Alikhan, Pallen)

- Exercise: Performance and interpretation of homology searches using NCBI Web BLAST, CDD on illustrative sequences:
