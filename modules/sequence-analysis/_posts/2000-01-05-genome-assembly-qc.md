# Genome assembly

###  Day 2

#####  Overview of the day

#####  Talk (Pallen):  *Microbial Genomics: Theory and Practice*

  -  _Microbial Genomics: Theory and Practice_ ([Powerpoint slides](https://github.com/mmbdtp/mmbdtp.github.io/raw/gh-pages/modules/sequence-analysis/_posts/2023_Week%203_Talk_Microbial_genomics.pptx))

##### Instructions for problem-based learning on genome assembly (Alikhan)

- Exercise: [hybrid and short-read-only assembly of sequenced reads](/seq-analysis/genome-assembly)

#####  Instructions for problem-based learning on assembly QC (Alikhan)

- Exercise: [perform QC and compare hybrid and short-read-only assemblies](/seq-analysis/assembly_qc) (using QUAST, webBlast a contig, Kraken, assembly graph with bandage etc.)
- Additional exercise: [Assess the Quality of some other (provided) assembled genomes](/seq-analysis/check_qc). Dataset will include assembled contigs of different strains that fail QC for one reason or another.

#####  Talk from Mark Pallen: *Amerithrax: from genome to culprit*

  - _Amerithrax: from genome to culprit_ ([Powerpoint slides](https://github.com/mmbdtp/mmbdtp.github.io/raw/gh-pages/modules/sequence-analysis/_posts/2023_Week%203_Talk_Amerithrax.pptx))
