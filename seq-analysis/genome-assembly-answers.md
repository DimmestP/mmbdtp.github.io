**Assemble the genome of our novel pathogen using short reads only** 

If you have a problem with this process. Here are some results I prepared earlier. 

* [contigs.fa](/seq-analysis/contigs.fa)
* [contigs.gfa](/seq-analysis/contigs.gfa)
* [shovill.corrections](/seq-analysis/shovill.corrections)
* [shovill.log](/seq-analysis/shovill.log)


**Assemble the genome of  our novel pathogen using both long and short reads (as a hybrid assembly)**

If you had a problem with generating an assembly with Unicycler. Here are some results I prepared earlier. 

* [long_assembly.fasta](/seq-analysis/long_assembly.fasta)
* [long_assembly.gfa](/seq-analysis/long_assembly.gfa)
* [unicycler.log](/seq-analysis/unicycler.log)
