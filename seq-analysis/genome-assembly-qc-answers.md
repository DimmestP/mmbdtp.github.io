## Exercise 1: Assessing genome assembly quality 

Many tools are available that assess sequence quality through read alignment, k-mer counting, gene finding, and other methods. Your exercise now is to compare and contrast the hybrid and short-read-only assemblies we prepared earlier using methods testing for Contiguity, Correctness, Completeness & Contamination (see above).

### Theory questions

**What is N50?**

**What is GC Content?** 

**What is "Genome Coverage"?** 

**How does BUSCO measure completeness?** 

**How does aligning to a reference genome help assess completeness?**

**How does Kraken/Bracken help assess contamination?**

### Practical questions

**What is the difference in N50, number of contigs, and L50 between the hybrid and short-read-only assemblies?**

**What is the difference in completeness between the hybrid and short-read-only assemblies?**

**Which assembly graph looks better between the hybrid and short-read-only assemblies (use Bandage)?**

**Try other tools and test for Contiguity, Correctness, Completeness & Contamination**

_You can try these different options on your own, or work in groups, or divide the different criteria between yourselves_
